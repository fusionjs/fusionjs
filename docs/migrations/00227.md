## React 16+ is now required

React 15 is no longer supported.

## `prepared` components called only once by default

As a result of the the new async SSR implementation, required to support hooks, there is a breaking change regarding how side effect functions are called when rendering `prepared` async components.

Consider the following example:
```js

import {prepared} from "fusion-react";

const MyAsyncComponent = prepared(effectFn)(MyComponent);

<div>
  <MyAsyncComponent foo="bar" />
  <MyAsyncComponent bar="baz" />
</div>
```

Before this change, the `effectFn` would be called twice, once for each rendered `MyAsyncComponent`.

With the new SSR implementation, `effectFn` will only be called once.

To restore the old behavior, unique `effectId` props must be added to each rendered prepared component.

```diff
<div>
 -  <MyAsyncComponent foo="bar" />
 -  <MyAsyncComponent bar="baz" />
 +  <AsyncComponent effectId="1" foo="bar" />
 +  <AsyncComponent effectId="2" bar="baz" />
</div>
```
