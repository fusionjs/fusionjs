## What is it?

> **fu·sion** — *noun*
>
> The process or result of joining two or more things together to form a single entity.

**Fusion.js**, Uber’s open source universal web framework, represents the fusion of the client and the server. It's geared for server-side rendering out of the box, and its plugin-driven architecture allows for complex frontend and backend logic to be encapsulated in a single plugin:

```js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Router from 'fusion-plugin-react-router';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(<div>...</div>);

  /*
  One line of code sets up everything you need for routing:
  - Server rendering
  - React Providers on both server and browser
  - Bundle splitting integration
  - Hot module reloading support
  */
  app.register(Router);

  return app;
}
```

We initially [built Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/) to make our own websites easier to maintain, but were so impressed with the benefits that we decided to offer it to the community as an open source project!
